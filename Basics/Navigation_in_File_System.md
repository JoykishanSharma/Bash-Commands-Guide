<h2>Navigation in File System</h2>

When working within a file system, the user is always working within some directory, which we call the current directory or the working directory. We can navigate these file system using these commands:-

<br>

<table>
    <th>Command</th>
    <th>Description</th>
    <tr>
        <td>
        
    pwd
</td>
        <td>Prints the user's working directory</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
        
    ls
</td>
        <td>Lists the contents of this directory (files and/or child directories, etc.)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
        
    ls -a
</td>
        <td>Show hidden ("dot") files</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
        
    ls -l
</td>
        <td>Show file details</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
        
    ls -l -a
</td>
        <td>Combine multiple flags (above two commands)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
        
    ls -la
</td>
        <td>the Above combined flags can also be written like this.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
        
    cd
</td>
        <td>Change to a different directory</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
        
    cd ..
</td>
        <td>This takes us to the parent directory (comes out from it's current directory - one level)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
        
    cd ~
</td>
        <td>This takes us to my home directory (usually /home/username or something similar)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
        
    cd ~user
</td>
        <td>change directory to user's home directory (replace "user" with your "user_name")</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
        
    cd .
</td>
        <td>current directory (won't do much of anything)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
        
    cd -
</td>
        <td>Goes back to the most recent directory</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
        
    cd ../..
</td>
        <td>jumps multiple directory levels</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
        
    cd "drag_and_drop_folder"
</td>
        <td>this changes directory to that particular folder</td>
    </tr>
